/// ACLMessage class represents messages sent from one agent to another. Each message follows the Agent Communication Language (ACL), a set of one or more message parameters, which defines which information each message must contain. Among these parameters are, for example, the type of communicative act (performative), sender, receiver and message content.

    /// indicates that subsequent messages in this conversation thread are to be directed to the replyTo agent
    var replyTo: Agent!
    /// content of the message
